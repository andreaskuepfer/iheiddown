### Symbols

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the [Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol Guide](https://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf).

\noindent Exponent or Superscript: $\mathrm{O^-}$

\noindent Subscript: $\mathrm{CH_4}$

To stack numbers or letters as in $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}}$, the subscript is defined first, and then the superscript is defined.

\noindent Delta: $\Delta$

<!--
The \noindent command does what you'd expect:  
it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. 
This was done here to match the format of the LaTeX thesis PDF.
-->

You can get around math mode's automatic italicizing in \LaTeX\ by using the argument `$\mathrm{formula here}$`, 
with your formula inside the curly brackets.  
(Notice the use of the backticks here which enclose text that acts as code.)

So, $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$ is written `$\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$`.

## Inline code

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.  
More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].
