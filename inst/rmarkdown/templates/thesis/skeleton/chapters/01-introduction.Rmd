# Introduction {#intro}

Here is a brief introduction into using *RMarkdown*.
_Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
_RMarkdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.
For more details on using _RMarkdown_ see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Commenting

<!-- 
If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file 
enclose it in a block like this.
-->

<!-- If it's just a single line, you can wrap it like this. -->

As you can see in the final PDF, the above comments are not printed.
This can be hugely helpful for keeping notes for yourself
right where you need them.
I'll be using them to add some notes for you about the functionality in this package.

<!--
The {#intro} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 1.  
These labels will automatically be generated (if not specified) by changing the spaces to hyphens and capital letters to lowercase.  
Look for the reference to this label at the beginning of Chapter 2.
