# Theory {#theory}

## Referencing

Your dissertation, and perhaps your theory/literature review chapter in particular,
will likely have plenty of citations.
Indeed, you will probably accumulate an armful of sources.
This section outlines how to assemble a bibliography and cite in text.

### Tips for bibliographies

- Like with thesis formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as thesis, the better. 
Typing in source after source is mind-numbing enough; do you really want to do it for hours on end in late May? 
Think of it as procrastination.
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept \LaTeX\ markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.
- You can add an iheiddown citation.^[@iheiddown2020]
