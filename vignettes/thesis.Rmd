`{iheiddown}`'s primary feature is to enable students of the Institute to write
their thesis in R-Markdown. It takes care of the annoying formatting and
automates the most repetitive tasks a student faces when writing scholarly
documents. In short, `{iheiddown}` allows its users to focus on the *content*
rather than the *formatting* of a thesis.

This guide will show you how to get up and running and start writing your thesis
in R while providing you with helpful tips and tricks to make you familiar with
the workflow of writing your very own scholarly documents in R.

## Installation

To use `{iheiddown}`'s template you'll need the following software:

1. Install [R](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/) and [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
2. Install a LATEX distribution:
    - [For MacOS](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
    - [For Windows](https://miktex.org/)
    - [For Linux](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
3. Install `{iheiddown}` by typing the following command
`remotes::install_github("jhollway/iheiddown")` in the R-Studio console. 

Note: typing `remotes::install_github("jhollway/iheiddown")` again will update
the package to the latest released version.

## Create your first thesis project

Creating your first thesis is easy! Let's look at how it is done. Before
we begin, we have to create a new R project by clicking on the file tab in the
top of the RStudio window and following the instructions of the prompt that
appears. Now that we have created an R project for our presentation, we can open
a new R-Markdown file. To do this click on the "plus file" logo in the top left
corner and then on "R-Markdown".

![Step 1: open a new project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhollway/iheiddown/develop/inst/vignettes/presentation/0-Open_Project.png){width="80%"}

After you have done this, a little pop-up helper will appear. The first thing we
will do is to select the `{iheiddown}` template for our presentation. To do so,
click on the "From Template" option on the left and select the
"Thesis {iheiddown}" template. Now give your presentation a name and click
on "OK".

Important note! Give your thesis project a name that starts with `00-` like
`00-MyThesis.Rmd`. This makes sure that the first knitted file is the main
thesis file and one of the chapters.

Congrats! You just created your first thesis project!

Hold on, this doesn't look anything like my Word processor!? To see your thesis,
you have to "knit" the code by clicking on the little "knit" button while 
viewing the `00-MyThesis.Rmd` file. This will run all the code chunks in every
chapter and convert the markdown code to a correctly formatted PDF document that
you will find in the `\versions` folder of your project.

Take a moment to read through the generated PDF to get acquainted with the
`{R-markdown}` syntax and to get a feel of the possibilities of `{iheiddown}`'s
thesis template. This first document is as much a tutorial as this vignette!


## Edit your thesis

This section will focus on giving you an overview of the elements of an
`{iheiddown}` thesis and give you a few tips and tricks to edit it.

### The different elements of a `{iheiddown}` thesis

After this initial preview, let's look at how the thesis project is structured
to better understand how to edit it. 

#### The main file

The main file contains two things: the YAML header and the preface of your
thesis. It is also the backbone of your thesis in the sense that this is where
you will want to knit your whole thesis from.

The YAML header is the place where the main options, metadata and formatting
options are set. You can set the title of your presentation here, add your name,
change the front matter of your thesis (abstract, acknowledgments, table of
content, etc.).

The second element in this file is the preface. The only crucial thing to know
here is that in order to create your package bibliography (the software you use
to render your thesis) you need to leave the first code chunk there.

#### The chapters

The chapters contain the meat of your thesis, this is where you will outline
your idea, run your analyses and draw your conclusions.

Chapters are structured in a similar way, so let us open the
`01-introduction.Rmd` chapter. In it, you will first find a YAML header that
where you can set various chapter level metadata and options.

Note that if for some reason you rename the chapter, you will need to specify
the new name in the YAML header too under the `input` option. Once you have done
this you can write away!

The last thing to know about individual chapters is that you can knit them
individually. This comes in handy when you want to generate only one part of
your thesis for your review.

#### The appendix and the references files

These files are a bit special as you might notice when you open them. 

The `99-references.Rmd` file generates the bibliography. This happens
automatically, so you will most likely not need to alter this file. Just know
that you can set the title of the references section in the first line.

The `98-appendix.Rmd` file allows you to showcase code, additional outputs and
more in a separate section to avoid unnecessarily cluttering the main body of
your thesis. This can be done by referencing code chunks from your main body
and printing the computations you did in your R chunks or by adding new ones.

#### The `_bookdown.yml` file

The `_bookdown.yml` file contains additional information for the YAML header
of the main `.Rmd` file. A standard user should not have to edit it. If for some
eason or another you still feel like you need to know that you can set
additional `.Rmd` subdirectories, set another output file than the standard
`\versions` file, and toggle the deletion of merged files.

#### The `\bib` folder

The bibliography folder contains two files; `packages.bib` and `references.bib`.
The former is automatically generated and cites the packages you use when
running your code chunks. You will not need to alter this.

On the other hand, the `references.bib` file is the place to dump the bibtex
citations that you will cite in your thesis.

#### The `\data` folder

The data folder is the place to put all the data that you use in the code chunk
of your analysis. Remember to keep it tidy so you can easily link data to
outputs down the line.

#### The `\figures` folder

The figures folder will contain all the graphical elements that you may want to
include in your thesis e.g. figures, graphs, or images. It also contains a file
named `SecretariatDocument.pdf` that you will need to replace with the one that
was handed to you by the PhD or Master's secretariat. Remember to rename the
file you got from the secretariat as `SecretariatDocument.pdf`. Otherwise
`{iheiddown}` will not recognize it.

#### The `\front-matter` folder

The front matter folder contains the front matter of your thesis. This is where
you will be able to edit the abbreviations part in the corresponding Latex file,
the acknowledgments or the abstract of your thesis in their respective `.Rmd`
files.

#### The `\versions` folder

This is where you will find the pdf file after your thesis has been knitted by
`{iheiddown}`.
