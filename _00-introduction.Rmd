# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the *R Markdown* template for writing a PhD Dissertation at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. This sample content is based on the [IHEID  LaTeX dissertation template](https://github.com/jhollway/iheidmytex) and the R Bookdown package.

This project was inspired by by the [oxforddown](https://github.com/ulyngs/oxforddown),[thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), [huskydown](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) packages. If you are new to working with `bookdown` and `rmarkdown`, please read over the great documentation provided by `thesisdown`, `oxforddown` and in the [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
